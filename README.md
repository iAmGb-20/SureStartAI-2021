# SureStartAI-2021
This is a repository for the Spring 2021 AI & Machine Learning virtual trainee program at SureStart, an organization connecting emerging AI talent to comprehensive technical curriculum and industry mentorship.


Day #1 - February 8th

Today was an introduction to the Spring 2021 SureStart program, an initiative connecting emerging AI talent to machine and deep learning curriculum. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Rochester majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in learning AI and Machine Learning toolkits and technologies in general so that I can develop apps that utilize AI as well as to create efficient systems that utilize the power of machine learning and AI.
I aim to understand:
- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Unsupervised and Supervised learning techniques

I am mostly interested in App development as well as Systems Programming. I hope to use the knowledge and hands-on experience from this program to make tools that will impact thousands of users using ethical AI development.
